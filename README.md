# "fake imessage"
I used to teach kids how to code in summer camps, and we decided to use repl.it for this since it was the easiest way to get everyone up and running. Well, imagine my amazement 4 years later when I remembered that I had an account and found all of the content from that time. This was by far my favorite project I led. Of course, if we had more than 2-3 days for this, this could have entirely gotten out of hand.
